A modern, responsive note-taking web app built with React (Vite) and Supabase. Users can log in, create notes, pin them, assign priorities (low, medium, high), and group them into custom projects.

This is a personal project focused on usability, clean design, and scalable architecture. It is currently a private, login-only app, with additional features planned for future development.
